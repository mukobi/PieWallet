					<td>Cache management options						<a class="tooltipcf">(?)
							<span><b>Choose caching level:</b> Cloudflare will cache different types of content depending on the caching level you adjust. The basic setting will cache most static resources (i.e., CSS, images, and JavaScript). The aggressive setting will cache all static resources, including ones with a query string.								<br />
								<br /><b>Purge cache</b> to see changes immediately! The purge option will remove all cached resources for your website and Cloudflare will fetch a new version of your site form the origin server.								<br />
								<br /><b>Development mode</b> is used if you want to make changes to your cacheable content (images, CSS, JavaScript) and see the changes right away. The development mode will bypass Cloudflare's accelerated cache. Once turned on, development mode will last for 3 hours and then automatically turn off.							</span>
