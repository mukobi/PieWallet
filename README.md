# PieWallet-Frontend-Development

PieWallet is a hybrid cryptocurrency wallet and social media web app built in PHP and JavaScript as a freelance project: If you crossed your favourite cryptocurrency with Venmo, you might get something like PieWallet. For security, users must record their private keys offline until ready for exchange with a linked partner, but public keys are paired with profiles and stored in PieWalletâ€™s database allowing for social interactions like user search, following/followers, and crypto requests.

Building PieWallet necessitated learning technical knowledge of social networks for functionality like user profile creation/login/editing and many-to-many nonreciprocal follow relationships; of API design and public API calling for updating balance and history information and propagating user actions through the network; and of blockchain and cryptocurrency to securely generate new private keys from a numeric or word-phrase seed on the front-end and correctly generate public keys from private keys in the 3 supported currencies of Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum.
